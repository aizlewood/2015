Over the course of my design career I've had the pleasure of working with the likes of NBC Universal, UNICEF UK, Code for America, the BBC, Nordea, Virgin Galactic and the British Medical Journal to name a few.  

I currently ply my trade at award-winning UX design agency Clearleft, based in Brighton, where I live with my wife and two wonderful daughters. I spend my ‘free time’ following Arsenal, drinking coffee and trying to head into the South Downs for a spot of mountain biking.  

## Digital marketing
Prior to dedicating my career to digital design, I led another life as a digital marketer.  It's no coincidence that I moved over to design after seeing so many products and ideas fail due to poor design and experience.
