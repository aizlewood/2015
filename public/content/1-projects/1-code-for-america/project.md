## Helping CfA help the US Government work more like the internet

Code for America were looking to update their online presence. They requested a design system that would work across a range of devices; modular, extendable code, and living documentation that allowed people of varying design and technical experience to contribute to the site.


Bay Area non-profit organisation **Code for America** helps to make US government digital services beautiful, simple and easy to use. Its recent site overhaul, conducted in partnership with UK-based UX agency Clearleft, brought the same values to its own online presence. At Clearleft, Jon Aizlewood handled visual design, freelancer Anna Debenham took care of the frontend build, while Jeremy Keith oversaw work and wrote JavaScript. At CfA, UX evangelist Cyd Harrell handled IA, CTO Mike Migurski implemented changes, and senior marketing manager Dana Oshiro managed the project.
